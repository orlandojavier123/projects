        <!-- job description goes here: -->
        Athletes work and compete at many levels. Most people think that professional athletes earn huge salaries. This is because high salaries are common in the elite leagues, such as the NBA, MLB, and NFL. The truth is that most athletes earn much less than this. It is common for some to work another job to pay their bills. However, all athletes share a love of, and a commitment to, physical competition.

        <h3>Education and Training</h3>
        <p>
          There is no strict education required to be a professional athlete. However, there are many sports scholarships offered to students by colleges. It's a good idea to take advantage of these school benefits.An athlete's career is very competitive, physically hazardous, and short. A good education can prepare you to find a new career once your athletic career is over. You may even be able to stay connected with your sport. You can coach, manage, scout, or commentate on sports if you have the right education and experience.

        <h3>Earnings</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- place as many paragraphs as you need in this section -->
          Salaries vary widely from sport to sport. Income is affected by individual skill level and the popularity of the sport. The more fans who watch the league, the higher the earnings of its athletes. For example, NHL players can earn millions of dollars a year. Those in the AHL (American Hockey League) often earn from about $40,000 to $150,000 a year. There is no cap on AHL salaries, though, so some players earn more.Most people in this career do not earn such huge sums. However, these athletes may still be able to live off of their sports earnings. They often make between $20,000 and $200,000 a year.
